todo: count number of keys/size of shm and clear subtables?
      -> counters for nkeys added as metric[7] to all data
todo: last updates counters everywhere
      -> update counter added to metric[6]
      -> does not work well with merging, max()?
todo: add "allways label"
      -> prom.counter("per_worker_foo", {foo="bar"}, "foo", "bar")
      -> where should this be stored?
todo: metric with labels print HELP and TYPE but no data when uninitialized
todo: convert all inputs to numbers to give a more userfriendly api
todo: values are lost on reload after loading values from shm, due to weak
      weak tables and lua gc beeing run before the metric is initialized.
      If this proves to be a problem, create a different data gc than __mode=v
todo: ensure only string/number type is inserted in tree (walk)
todo: make logging disabled more efficient (if block?)
